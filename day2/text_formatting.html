&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer programming is defined as telling a computer what to 
do through a special set of instructions which are then 
interpreted by the computer to perform some task(s). These 
instructions can be specified in one or more programming 
languages including (but not limited to) Java, PHP, C, and 
C++. A computer goes through a series of steps whose purpose 
is to achieve something - a series of steps that are 
instructed to it in great detail by computer programs. 
Essentialy, computer programming is the process by which these 
programs are designed and implemented.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While computer programming can be a great tool used to achieve 
many things, there are a few misconceptions when it comes to 
the subject, a few misconceptions that should be cleared up. 
One misconception about computer programming is that you would 
need to have some kind of special software to write programs - 
this is hardly the case.
