<h1>Cats and Dogs</h1>
<b>I have a cat and thinking to buy a doy. Will they fight?</b>
<p>Comedic action-adventure that mixes live action with cutting-edge CGI and animatronic effects.

Cats & Dogs uncovers the truth about the high-tech, secret war being waged in neighborhoods everywhere that humans aren't even aware of: an eternal struggle between the two great armies of Cats and Dogs.

The story follows a Cat plan to destroy a new vaccine that, if developed, would destroy all human allergies to Dogs, and the Dogs' efforts to stop the Cats from executing their plan.</p>
<p>Cats are playing the antagonists while dogs are the protagonists which already concludes the plot. There are 3 mini highlights that play upon the animals unique traits, one of them being that a dog has to "diffuse" a bomb by cutting the red cable and the dog saying: "...but I am color blind". The characters, including the humans, do not really undergo any noticeable transformation. Once captured, wife screams a lot, with is a terrible stereotype IMO. </p>
<p>Tobey McGuire (Spiderman) voices the protagonist dog, a puppy accidentally inserted into the conflict. Alex Baldwin, Joe Pantoliano, and Susan Sarandon do some of the other dogs. One of the great voices of our age, Charleton Heston is the leader of the dogs, but his part is brief. Sean Hayes gives a nice, over-the-top, supervillianesque performance as the cat antagonist, and Jon Lovitz does a good turn as his assistant. In general the animal voices are the highlight of the movie, along with the continually funny joke of the dogs possessing technology and intelligence about which we humans have no clue.</p>
