<h1>Metaphor</h1>
<p>A metaphor is a figure of speech that is used to make a comparison between two things that aren't alike but do have something in common. Unlike a simile, where two things are compared directly using like or as, a metaphor's comparison is more indirect, usually made by stating something is something else.</p>
<p>For example, take the language used to describe a debate:</p>
<q>A tree is a reasonable metaphor for how neurons look. </q></br>
<q>Trees have branches and branching roots, and neurons have dendrites and branching axons.</q></br>
<q>But the most obvious similarities end at the structural level. The functional level is a different matter.</q></br>
<p>A metaphor is a word or phrase used to describe something as if it was something else. A metaphor isn't a comparison – that's a simile, where you say one thing is 'like' another (“Her eyes were like diamonds”). Instead, a metaphor is simply a statement where you are saying that one thing is another.</p>
